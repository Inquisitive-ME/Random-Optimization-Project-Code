 # Part 1: 4 Random Search Algorithms
 The Code is broken into 3 jupyter notebooks for each problem. The jupyter notebooks use common.py
 for common functions shared between the problems

 1. Continous Peaks Problem
    ContinousPeaks.ipynb - Contains code to create all graphs for the Continous Peaks Problem Section of the Report

2. Knapsack Problem
   Knapsack.ipynb - Contains code to create all graphs for the Knapsack Problem section of the report

3. Max K Colors Problem
   MaxKColor.ipynb - contains code to create all graphs for the Max K Colors Problem in the report

For this section all graphs were saved form the Jupyter Notebooks

# Part 2: Finiding Weights for Neural Network
The data from Assaignment 1 is in the data folder
All the code for This assaignment is contained in NeuralNetworks/mlrose_train_test.py
This generates all the plots, but takes a very long time to run so it also generates and saves
files for the results.

I also forked the mlrose library to implement timing and counting function calls this code is in
the mlrose folder and is a submodule to the forked repo
